Our tasks:
Geometry
- [?] Perfect satellite/orbit number fraction 
        -Inclination angles and other parameters of orbits.
- [+] Best orbit altitude?
- [+] Optimal Earth sectorization (very important) 
- [+] Draw a scheme which angles where etc.
       -10, 75
Physics
- [+] Neglecting assumptions (zero connection delay, etc.)
       How to get rid of assumtions (techniques and algorithms)
- [+] Calculate on paper doppler shift (earth ~137kHz) to be at max 2.5kHz
ML
- [?] Choose augmentation variable (e.g. the number of orbits, the number of satellites on them, and their inclination angles)
- [-] Generate train data set 
- [-] Get the constellation (which model?)
Matlab
- [-] Create a set of sectors
- [?] Learn how to check if the sector is covered (6 points?)
- [+] Model with toolbox and get a score
- [+] Dowload pictures and gifs for a presentation
Presentation
- [+] Cover all assumptions and difficulties
- [+] Cover doppler effect
- [?] The task can be solved using ML and explain how we want to structure it.
